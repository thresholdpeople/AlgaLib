DESCRIPTION::
An link::Classes/AlgaNode:: is the fundamental element of link::Classes/Alga::. Conceptually, it is very similar to a single module of a modular synthesizer, which, however, can be dynamically created, replaced and patched on the fly.

There are 4 important features that make link::Classes/AlgaNode::s different from other forms of patching already present in emphasis::SuperCollider::.

NUMBEREDLIST::
## Connecting link::Classes/AlgaNode::s together will trigger a process of interpolation between the current state of the receiver and the future one where the new connection will take place. This feature applies to any operation: from creation, to connection and replacement of nodes.

NOTE::
Interpolation is a property that belongs to the emphasis::receiver:: of the connection, not the emphasis::sender::. It is in fact possible to specify different interpolation times for each parameter of a emphasis::receiver::. Any emphasis::sender:: that connects to those parameters will respect the relative interpolation times.
::

## Whenever a new connection is made, link::Classes/Alga:: takes care of running any necessary conversions of rate and number of channels: link::Classes/Alga:: takes a emphasis::patch anything into anything:: approach.

## Whenever a new connection is made, link::Classes/Alga:: takes care of ordering the groups of the link::Classes/AlgaNode::s on the server so that they respect the order of connections, preventing the introduction of blockSize delays in the signal chain. This feature is only limited by feedback connections. In such cases, there will obviously be an emphasis::blockSize:: delay introduced between the last node in the chain and the first one.

## link::Classes/AlgaNode::s do not only specify connections via their parameter names, as it is usual in emphasis::SuperCollider::, but also by emphasis::output names::. In fact, thanks to the link::Classes/AlgaSynthDef:: class it is possible to define specific emphasis::symbol to channel(s):: mappings to address a specific output - or outputs - of a node. An link::Classes/AlgaNode::, then, is not only described by its emphasis::inputs::, but, like in modular synthesizers, also by its emphasis::outputs::.
::

By going through the help files and the emphasis::Examples:: folder, hopefully all these notions will be clearer.


CLASSMETHODS::


METHOD:: new
Create a new link::Classes/AlgaNode::.
ARGUMENT:: def
Mandatory argument. It accepts either a emphasis::UGen function:: or a symbol to lookup a defined link::Classes/AlgaSynthDef::.
ARGUMENT:: args
Define default arguments for the parameters of the function or link::Classes/AlgaSynthDef::. These can be link::Classes/Number::s, link::Classes/Array::s, link::Classes/AlgaNode::s, link::Classes/AlgaTemp::s or link::Classes/AlgaArg::s.
ARGUMENT:: interpTime
Specify the interpolation time it takes whenever making a new connection to any parameter of this link::Classes/AlgaNode::.
ARGUMENT:: interpShape
Specify the interpolation shape that is to be used to perform new connections. This must be defined with an link::Classes/Env:: that always starts at 0 and ends at 1. If not specified, a single ramp code::Env([0, 1], 1):: is used by default.
ARGUMENT:: playTime
Specify the fading in / fading out time that it takes for this link::Classes/AlgaNode:: to play through speakers. These values are applied when calling the emphasis::play:: or emphasis::stop:: functions.
ARGUMENT:: playSafety
Specify a different safety method to use to scale the output of a node when using the emphasis::play:: method. Accepted values are: code::'clip', 'tanh', 'softclip', 'limiter', 'none'::.
ARGUMENT:: sched
Just like any other link::Classes/AlgaNode:: method, the current function can be scheduled at specific times in the future, according to the clock that the link::Classes/Alga:: instance booted on the server is using.
ARGUMENT:: schedInSeconds
Specify if all sched actions should be scheduled in seconds, opposing to beats. Default is code::false::.
ARGUMENT:: outsMapping
It works just like link::Classes/AlgaSynthDef::'s emphasis::outsMapping:: argument, but for the case of using an emphasis::UGen function:: as the emphasis::obj:: argument. Specify new mappings by an array that maps symbols to specific output channels. If not specified, the default code::\out1, \out2, etc..:: symbols can be used to address specific channels.
ARGUMENT:: server
Specify a link::Classes/Server:: to instantiated the link::Classes/AlgaNode:: on. This link::Classes/Server:: must have had link::Classes/Alga:: booted on it. It defaults to code::Server.default::.


private:: new_ap
private:: debug


INSTANCEMETHODS::


METHOD:: play
Play the link::Classes/AlgaNode:: to SuperCollider's output. Note that this method also ensures that no dangerous audio signals are forwarded to your speaker's output, with an implementation inspired by the SafetyNet quark ( https://github.com/adcxyz/SafetyNet ).
ARGUMENT:: time
Define a temporary connection time that the method takes to complete, applying the necessary interpolations. If not specified, emphasis::playTime:: will be used.
ARGUMENT:: chans
Specify an link::Classes/Array:: of output channels to play, which can contain emphasis::outsMapping:: symbols. It's also possible to just specify a number, in which case it determines how many channels will be played.
ARGUMENT:: scale
Specify a link::Classes/Number:: to scale the output by.
ARGUMENT:: out
Specify a link::Classes/Bus:: index to play the node to.
ARGUMENT:: sched
Just like any other link::Classes/AlgaNode:: method, the current function can be scheduled at specific times in the future, according to the clock that the link::Classes/Alga:: instance booted on the server is using.
code::
AlgaNode({ SinOsc.ar([440, 450]) }).play //Play both channels

AlgaNode({ SinOsc.ar([440, 450]) }).play(chans: 2) //Play both channels, explicitly

AlgaNode({ SinOsc.ar([440, 450]) }).play(chans: [0]) //Play first channel mono (same as 'chans: 1')

AlgaNode({ SinOsc.ar([440, 450]) }).play(chans: [0, 0]) //Play first channel stereo

AlgaNode({ SinOsc.ar([440, 450]) }).play(chans: [0, 1]) //Play both channels, explicitly (same as 'chans: 2')

AlgaNode({ SinOsc.ar([440, 450]) }).play(chans: [0, 1, 1, 0]) //Quadraphonic
::


METHOD:: stop
Stop the output to speakers.


METHOD:: clear
Clear the link::Classes/AlgaNode::, dropping all connections in place (with appropriate interpolation) as well as the output to speakers.


METHOD:: replace
Replace the current content of the link::Classes/AlgaNode::. This method also takes care of restoring all running connections, applying the correct connection times and rate / channels conversions.
ARGUMENT:: def
Mandatory argument. It accepts either a emphasis::UGen function:: or a symbol to lookup a defined link::Classes/AlgaSynthDef::.
ARGUMENT:: args
Define default arguments for the parameters of the function or link::Classes/AlgaSynthDef::. Note that these will be applied in regards to emphasis::interpTime::.
ARGUMENT:: time
Define a temporary connection time that the method takes to complete, applying the necessary interpolations.
ARGUMENT:: sched
Just like any other link::Classes/AlgaNode:: method, the current function can be scheduled at specific times in the future, according to the clock that the link::Classes/Alga:: instance booted on the server is using.
ARGUMENT:: outsMapping
It works just like link::Classes/AlgaSynthDef::'s emphasis::outsMapping:: argument, but for the case of using an emphasis::UGen function:: as the emphasis::obj:: argument. Specify new mappings by an array that maps symbols to specific output channels.
ARGUMENT:: reset
Specify whether the parameters should keep their old connections or they should be reset to the default values. This argument either takes a boolean value (emphasis::true:: / emphasis::false::) or an link::Classes/Array:: specifying the individual names of the parameters to reset, via link::Classes/Symbol::s (e.g. code::[\freq, \amp]::. A emphasis::true:: boolean value will reset all parameters, while the link::Classes/Array:: only some of them.
ARGUMENT:: keepOutsMappingIn
Specify whether the current emphasis::output channels mapping:: of the link::Classes/AlgaNode::s connected to the inputs of this one should be maintained.
ARGUMENT:: keepOutsMappingOut
Specify whether the current emphasis::output channels mapping:: of the link::Classes/AlgaNode::s connected to the outputs of this one should be maintained.
ARGUMENT:: keepScalesIn
Specify whether the emphasis::scales:: of all the link::Classes/AlgaNode::s connected to the inputs of this one should be maintained.
ARGUMENT:: keepScalesOut
Specify whether the emphasis::scales:: of all the link::Classes/AlgaNode::s connected to the outputs of this one should be maintained.


METHOD:: from
Connect the specific input parameter of this link::Classes/AlgaNode:: to the output of an link::Classes/AlgaNode::, link::Classes/Number::, link::Classes/Array::, link::Classes/AlgaTemp:: or link::Classes/AlgaArg::.
ARGUMENT:: sender
An link::Classes/AlgaNode::, link::Classes/Number::, link::Classes/Array::, link::Classes/AlgaTemp:: or link::Classes/AlgaArg::.
ARGUMENT:: param
Which parameter to connect to.
ARGUMENT:: chans
An optional link::Classes/Symbol:: or link::Classes/Array:: to specify which of the emphasis::output channels mapping:: to take from the output of the emphasis::sender::. If not specified, all channels will be used.
code::
(
a = AlgaNode(
    { SinOsc.ar([220, 440, 880, 1760])},
    outsMapping: [\one, [0, 1], \two, [2, 3], \three, 2, \four, 3]
)
)

b = AlgaNode({ \in.ar([0, 0]) }).play  //a simple 2 channel bypass
b.from(a, chans: \one)   //connects \one == [0, 1]
b.from(a, chans: \two)   //connects \two == [2, 3]
b.from(a, chans: [0, 3]) //connects [0, 3], a custom channels mapping
::
ARGUMENT:: scale
An optional link::Classes/Number:: or link::Classes/Array::. If it is a number, the value works as a multiplier of the output of the emphasis::sender::. If it is an array, it can be specified in two different ways:
NUMBEREDLIST::
## 4 elements, specify a emphasis::linlin:: connection: code::[-1, 1, 0, 10]::.
## 2 elements, specify a emphasis::linlin:: connection but assume that the input range is -1 to 1: code::[0, 10]::.
::
Note that all the values can be specified as arrays, in which case they map for specific channels. For example, code::[-1, [1, 2], 0, [10, 20]]:: will scale the first channel to code::[-1, 1, 0, 10]::, and the second one to code::[-1, 2, 0, 20]::.
ARGUMENT:: time
Define a temporary connection time that the method takes to complete, applying the necessary interpolations.
ARGUMENT:: shape
Define a temporary shape to be used in the interpolation process. This must be defined with an link::Classes/Env:: starting at 0 and ending at 1.
ARGUMENT:: forceReplace
Force a code::replace:: call instead of interpolating the values.
ARGUMENT:: sched
Just like any other link::Classes/AlgaNode:: method, the current function can be scheduled at specific times in the future, according to the clock that the link::Classes/Alga:: instance booted on the server is using.

//Change \freq parameter. Note how it interpolates to new value over 2 seconds
a <<.freq 220;

//Declare a square oscillator with variable frequency 1 to 100
b = AlgaNode({ Pulse.ar(LFNoise1.kr(1).range(1, 100)) });

//Map the b node to a's \freq parameter, scaling the -1 to 1 range to 100 to 1000.
//The interpolation will take 5 seconds to complete

//This will use a's interpTime, 2
a.mixFrom(c, \freq, scale:[-100, 100]);

//Clear over 3 seconds. Note how the interpolation will bring us back
//to just having b modulating a's frequency parameter
c.clear(time:3);

//Clear over 5 seconds. No more connections:
//now we'll interpolate back to a's \freq default value, 440
b.clear(time:5);

//Bye bye
a.clear(time:3);

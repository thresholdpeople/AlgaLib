DESCRIPTION::
An link::Classes/AlgaPattern:: is the polyphonic counterpart of an link::Classes/AlgaNode::. All the basic concepts that define link::Classes/AlgaNode::s also apply to link::Classes/AlgaPattern::s. However, link::Classes/AlgaPattern::s also support link::Classes/Pattern::s as modifiers for their parameters.

It is highly suggested to look into the Examples folder for more advanced usage of link::Classes/AlgaPattern::s.


CLASSMETHODS::


METHOD:: new
Create a new link::Classes/AlgaPattern::.
ARGUMENT:: def
Mandatory argument. It accepts either a emphasis::UGen function::, a symbol to lookup a defined link::Classes/AlgaSynthDef:: or an link::Classes/Event:: describing the pattern.
ARGUMENT:: interpTime
Specify the interpolation time it takes whenever making a new connection to any parameter of this link::Classes/AlgaPattern::.
ARGUMENT:: interpShape
Specify the interpolation shape that is to be used to perform new connections. This must be defined with an link::Classes/Env:: that always starts at 0 and ends at 1. If not specified, a single ramp code::Env([0, 1], 1):: is used by default.
ARGUMENT:: playTime
Specify the fading in / fading out time that it takes for this link::Classes/AlgaPattern:: to play through speakers. These values are applied when calling the emphasis::play:: or emphasis::stop:: functions.
ARGUMENT:: playSafety
Specify a different safety method to use to scale the output of a node when using the emphasis::play:: method. Accepted values are: code::'clip', 'tanh', 'softclip', 'limiter', 'none'::.
ARGUMENT:: sched
Just like any other link::Classes/AlgaPattern:: method, the current function can be scheduled at specific times in the future, according to the clock that the link::Classes/Alga:: instance booted on the server is using.
ARGUMENT:: schedInSeconds
Specify if all sched actions should be scheduled in seconds, opposing to beats. Default is code::false::.
ARGUMENT:: tempoScaling
Specify if all timed actions should be scaled by the clock's tempo. Default is code::false::.
ARGUMENT:: sampleAccurateFuncs
Set if the link::Classes/Function::s used in the code::'def':: parameter should be sample accurate or not. Defaults to true.
ARGUMENT:: player
Set an instance of a link::Classes/AlgaPatternPlayer:: that will be used to trigger the pattern.
ARGUMENT:: server
Specify a link::Classes/Server:: to instantiated the link::Classes/AlgaPattern:: on. This link::Classes/Server:: must have had link::Classes/Alga:: booted on it. It defaults to code::Server.default::.


private:: addAlgaNoteEventType


INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: advance
Advance the link::Classes/AlgaPattern:: manually.
ARGUMENT:: sched
Schedule the triggering at a specific time.

METHOD:: step
Alias for emphasis::advance::.

METHOD:: value
Alias for emphasis::advance::.

METHOD:: stopPattern
Stop the link::Classes/AlgaPattern::.
ARGUMENT:: sched
Schedule the stop at a specific time.

METHOD:: useMultiChannelExpansion
Set if the link::Classes/AlgaPattern:: should treat multi channel expansion like an link::Classes/AlgaNode:: or not.

METHOD:: multiChannelExpansion
Alias for emphasis::useMultiChannelExpansion::.

METHOD:: replaceDur
Set if emphasis::replace:: should be executed when changing the code::'dur':: parameter.

METHOD:: stopPatternBeforeReplace
Set the mode for how code::replace:: should be executed. If code::true:: (default), the pattern will be stopped before the replace happens. If code::false::, the pattern will only be stopped after the entire code::replace:: has happened. This case allows to perform both the fade in and fade out stages of the code::replace::.

METHOD:: schedSustainInSeconds
Set if the code::'sustain':: parameter should be scheduled in seconds. If false (default), it will be scheduled using the AlgaPattern's clock, whose tempo could be scaled.

METHOD:: sustainToDur
Set if the code::'dur':: parameter should be added to the code::'sustain':: one. Basically, this permits to scale the code::'sustain':: according to code::'dur'::.

METHOD:: sampleAccurateFuncs
Set if the link::Classes/Function::s used in the code::'def':: parameter should be sample accurate or not. Defaults to true.

EXAMPLES::
code::
(
//Boot Alga
Alga.boot({
	//Declare a simple AlgaSynthDef.
	//Note that for it to be used in an AlgaPattern it must free itself.
	//Also, note the 'sampleAccurate' argument. This allows the AlgaSynthDef to use OffsetOut instead of Out
	//for sample accurate retriggering.
	AlgaSynthDef(\sinePerc, {
		SinOsc.ar(\freq.kr(440)) * EnvPerc.ar
	}, sampleAccurate: true).add;

	//Wait for definition to be sent to server
	s.sync;

	//Create an AlgaPattern and play it.
	//Unlike Pbind, AlgaPatterns use an Event to describe the parameter -> value mapping.
	a = AlgaPattern((
		def: \sinePerc,
		dur: 0.5
	)).play(chans: 2);
});
)

//Interpolate over the new Pseq. 'sched: 1' triggers it at the next beat
a.from(Pseq([220, 440, 880], inf), \freq, time: 3, sched: 1);

//Interpolate over the new Pwhite.
a.from(Pwhite(220, 880), \freq, time: 3, sched: 1);

//Interpolation can be sampled and held instead of being dynamic
a.from(Pseq([220, 440, 880], inf), \freq, sampleAndHold: true, time: 3, sched: 1);

//Change \dur does not trigger interpolation (yet), but it applies the changes directly
a.from(Pwhite(0.03, 0.5), \dur, sched: 1);

//Alternatively, the 'replaceDur' option can be used to trigger a 'replace' call, allowing for volume transitions
a.replaceDur = true;

//'The stopPatternBeforeReplace' option permits to either just stop the pattern before replacing (true),
//or to wait for the crossfade to finish before stopping the old one (false)
a.stopPatternBeforeReplace = false;

//Now it will 'replace'
a.from(0.25, \dur, time: 3, sched: 1);

//Bye bye
a.clear(time: 2);
